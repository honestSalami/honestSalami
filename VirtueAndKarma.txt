Reading though Thompson's response to the critiques of "why I am not a Buddhist" I realized that Socrate's idea that Virtue is the only Good can be used to make the universe fair, in the same way that Karma makes the universe fair.

Lets take the question "why do Bad things happen to Good people?". [why does being good does not improve your well being, as Thompson puts it]. Karma was developed to answer this question by saying that "actually, they did bad things in a past life, so they actually deserved it". You could take VoG as a different answer to it, which says "actually, you are mistaken on what you think is Bad. If you think that Bad is the MISUSE of things, then no one ever goes through anything Bad that is not their own making. So even in an uncaring universe [whether gods or atoms], your consequences are fair".

Though an interesting reading, I don't think its a good one. The power of VoG is not in making people feel bad, but in empowering them to live a good life by focusing only on things they can do something about. Its not about the universe, or about whats fair. Its about what you do with your life.

Another thing I wanted to touch on is how VoG is like the extreme version of "worry only about what you can control". You start with the DoC (the is) and you step to InCut Focus (the ought) relatively easily. But at the end of your juurney of internalizing InCut, when you feel it instead of just thinking about it and struggling with it, you see VoG as the only way.

aspirational version, what it feels like to fully embody DofC and InCut focus.

I also wanna talk about my idea of internalization of VoG through faith. That to accept VoG you would have to accept the Stoic idea of Virtue, and accepting the value of Stoic virtue is a matter of Faith. This kinda blurs the line between Religion and Philosophy in Stoicism. But that is probably for the better, religion is a needlessly restricted protestant concept anyway.
