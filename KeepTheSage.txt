the idea of the Stoic Sage is useful not just as inspiration, not just as an anchor for philosophising about the end product of this transformation. Its useful for keeping us aware of our limitations as humans going on this path to salvation... I mean ataraxia. We can mold images of the Sage that critique other tradition's ideas of the aspirational ideal. Contrasting the Sage with the Buddha, for example, would be a useful way to distinguish Stoicism from buddhism, and a good point to compare both traditions' idea of salvation (sagehood vs nirvanna). It can help us keep grounded: where the buddhist think that the buddha is omniscient, we see that the sage is quite limited in knowledge. Where Buddhist Modernist define enlightenment as ridding of automatic identification of the self, we can sidestep the question of self identification and focus on virtuous living.

there is even a long debate on what a buddha can an cannot do, which actions are outside of what he would do given he is enlightened, which is parallel to what limitations a sage would have on their actions. Both are conceived as being unable to do unskillfull or vicious things. Which tradition is more stringent? which is more grounded?

My argument is not that sagehood is realizeable and so we must keep it. I argue that the figure of the Sage is useful as both a reflection of our ideals AND an anchor for comparisong with other religions. So we should keep it, as another tool for cosmopolitan conversation making :).
